    Number 10
    i learned that arrow functions can really help shorten the amount of code you have to do. it helps a lot. i also learned the difference between variable definitions. you use const when you dont want to reassign anything to it. when you use let it can be reassigned anywhere in the scope. when you use var the variable might or might not work in the code block or loop you use it in. usually using let and const is better than using var.
